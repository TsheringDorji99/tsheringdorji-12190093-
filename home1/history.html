            <br>late Blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicideswhen necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important.</p>

              <b>Early Blight </b><br> Early Blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is found wherever potatoes are grown.<br> Treatment 1. planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties.<br> 2. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible.<br> 3. Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease.</p><br><br><br>
